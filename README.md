site-status-checker
===================

An application for monitoring website uptime status.
It should alert via an SMS and/or e-mail when the site has been down for example 3, 10, 50, 100 and 500 consecutive tries and later send up notification once the site comes up again.
The notification should contain the reason of the last error.

What does it mean "site is down"?
- incorrect HTTP response code
- response is not wi thin desired time limits
