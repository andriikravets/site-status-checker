site-status-checker
===================

An application for monitoring website uptime status.
It should alert via an SMS and/or e-mail when the site has been down for example 3, 10, 50, 100 and 500 consecutive tries and later send up notification once the site comes up again.
The notification should contain the reason of the last error.

What does it mean "site is down"?
- incorrect HTTP response code
- response is not wi thin desired time limits


How to(magical version):
===================

To install this application you have to deeply breath with a sweet smell of just made Java code. 
The taste of Java world will explode your universe and you'll understand why the answer is 42.
There are no more pain in the world only bright shine under you thumbs. 
The young but very wisdom knight Maven will help you to build and pack application. He made an instructions for his brave servant - Terminal. 
Small servant with instruction presented in file StatusChecker can execute application.
Brave knight can change his instruction if you give him another magical manuscript with configuration(application.properties).
Actually he can do it even between every servant execution, just put the manuscript to the config tower.
Have a nice day. =)
